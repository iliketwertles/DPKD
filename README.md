# DPKD
simple ~~python~~ nim fetch

idk what to put here tbh but it supports Arch, Debian, and Fedora based distros, and now MacOS and OSX (will add others if wanted)

feel free to pr or make issue 

currently can get packages from: pacman, apt, dnf, brew, chromebrew(crew), emerge(kinda), apk(i think)

## Funky version
gentoo packages only and the rest is questionable, originally made it different for my system to streamline it as much as possible
